### Group Name: MalAI

#### Members:
- ##### Long Nguyen: Nguye2L6@mail.uc.edu
- ##### Luqman Al Hasni: alhasnld@mail.uc.edu

#### Project Tasks:
- Research LLM models that could be utilized as an infrastructure and a starting point of the LLM models to be built.
- Research possible decompilation methods.
- Research and find datasets that will be utilized to train the LLM models.
- Research how to utilize Ghidra as a plug-in.
- Build a Ghidra plugin
- Explored different variations of LLM4Decompile (Original Model, SK2)
- Introduce malware samples into existing binary-source datasets (exebench, decompilebench, idioms)
- Explore possible tools to build datasets (Pairs of C/C++ and Binary) like CodableLLM
- Preprocess and refine the datasets that will be utilized in the application to train the LLM models.
- Integrate LLM fintuned model
- Train LLM model to analyze executable files and decompile them into C-Code.
- Test the models analysis of C code and Assembly code.
- Document the analyzation performance of the built models in comparison to other recent models that target the same criteria.
- Develop the analysis page that showcases the analyzation of both C and Assembly codes.
- Develop the malware detection result page.
- Demo MalAI
- Deploy Application (If feasible)
- Develop a landing webpage for MalAI
