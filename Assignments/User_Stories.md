## **Project Title:** MalAI


### **Goal Statement:**

- Malware analysis tool that utilizes reverse engineering and artificial intelligence models to analyze executable files and detect malware.


### **User Stories Examples:**

- As a streamer, I enjoy playing a lot of games and sharing my content with other people. However, I am often reluctant to use any executable files (games) because I am afraid they might harm my computer. Therefore, I utilize MalAI to identify any potential harm in the executable file so that I am assured that the game will not cause any harm to my device.
- As a software developer, I often download many executable files for various reasons (testing applications, downloading coding-related software, etc.). However, this habit opens a lot of doors for my computer to get harmed. Therefore, I utilize MalAI to identify any malware in the executable files I intend to use. Furthermore, I also utilize MalAI to generate and read Assembly and C++ codes to further analyze any suspicious executable files and ensure that the file will only do what it is intended to do.
