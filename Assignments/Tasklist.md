#### Members:
- ##### Long Nguyen: Nguye2L6@mail.uc.edu
- ##### Luqman Al Hasni: alhasnld@mail.uc.edu

#### Project Tasks:
- Research LLM models that could be utilized as an infrastructure and a starting point of the LLM models to be built.
- Develop the application home screen. 
- Research how to utilize Ghidra as a plug-in. 
- Preprocess and refine the datasets that will be utilized in the application to train the LLM models.
- Train LLM model to analyze executable files and decompile them into C-Code.
- Integrate Ghidra as a plug-in to disassemble the executable files into Assembly-code.
- Test the models analysis of C code and Assembly code.
- Document the analyzation performance of the built models in comparison to other recent models that target the same criteria.
- Develop the analyzation page of the application that showcases the analyzation of both C and Assembly codes.
- Build the malware detection back-end part of the application (still in progress in terms of applicable tools).
- Develop the malware detection result page of the application.
