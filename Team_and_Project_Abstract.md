## Project Abstract:
- MalAI is an AI-powered Ghidra plugin that aims to reduce the time taken in reverse engineering by improving the accuracy of existing decomplication processes. This will be achieved by finetuning an LLM on ASM-Source pairs using existing datasets such as Exebench and decompile bench, extending work from LLM4Decompile. MalAI's model will be integrated directly into Ghidra as a decomplication tool to access more human-readable C-Code. Additionally, extra functionalities such as malware analysis will be enabled through these trained models and outputs.
