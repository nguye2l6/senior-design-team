## [LLM4Decompile](https://github.com/albertan017/LLM4Decompile)

"LLM4Decompile is the pioneering open-source large language model dedicated to decompilation. Its current version supports decompiling Linux x86_64 binaries, ranging from GCC's O0 to O3 optimization levels, into human-readable C source code. Our team is committed to expanding this tool's capabilities, with ongoing efforts to incorporate a broader range of architectures and configurations."

## [CodableLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22066)

"CodableLLM, a Python framework designed to automate the creation and curation of datasets by mapping decompiled functions to their corresponding source functions. "

## [SK2Decompile](https://github.com/albertan017/LLM4Decompile/tree/main/sk2decompile)

"SK²Decompile is a novel two-phase framework for binary decompilation using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach decomposes the complex decompilation task into two manageable phases:"

## [Exebench Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jordiae/exebench)

"ExeBench is a dataset of millions of C functions paired with dependencies and metadatada such that at least a subset of it can be executed with IO pairs."

## [Decompile-Bench Dataset](https://github.com/albertan017/LLM4Decompile/tree/main/decompile-bench)

"Decompile-Bench is the first open-source dataset comprising two million binary-source function pairs condensed from 100 million collected function pairs, i.e., 450GB of binaries compiled from permissively licensed GitHub projects."

## [Idioms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04536)

" Idioms, a new neural decompilation approach to finetune any LLM into a neural decompiler capable of generating the appropriate user-defined type definitions alongside the decompiled code. "

## [Realtype Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ejschwartz/idioms-realtype/blob/main/README.md)

"REALTYPE, a comprehensive dataset containing 154,301 training functions, 540 validation functions, and 2,322 test functions. Unlike existing benchmarks, REALTYPE includes a substantial number of user-defined types (UDTs) extracted from real-world C code repositories on GitHub. "
